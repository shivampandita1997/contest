

// NOTE :ALL THE "--->" ARE QUERIES.

// Firstly , create three tables(normalised tables) namely : flightdetails(flightno  int(primarykey),airname varchar , dest varchar ,price varchar )
										departuredetails(flightno int(foreignkey),departdetails,arrivaldetails)
											timingdetails(flightno int(foreign key),departtime,arrivaltime)

1--->Create table flightdetails(flightno int primary key ,airname varchar(20) , dest varchar(20) ,price varchar(20));

2--->Create table departuredetails(flightno int(foreignkey),departdetails varchar(20),arrivaldetails varchar(20));

3--->Create table timingdetails(flightno int(foreign key),departtime,arrivaltime);

//similarly create other tables.


//In the enter details section , the form.html page is submitted to the database using the following queries.
//IN THE ONCLICKLISTNER OF THE SUBMIT BUTTON, FOLLOWING QUERIES NEED TO BE EXECUTED.
4--->  Insert into flightdetails("flightno","airname","dest","price") values ("?","?","?","?"));

5--->  Insert into departuredetails(departdetails varchar(20),arrivaldetails varchar(20)) values ("?","?","?"));

6--->  Insert into timingdetails(departtime,arrivaltime) values ("?","?");

// These queries can be used to insert the data inside the database tables.


//ON THE MAIN USER INTERFACE , MAINLY TWO BUTTONS ARE THERE, "ENTER DETAILS" AND "INQUIRE DETAILS".

//In "enter details" ,the anchor<a> tag automatically opens the form.html file and the form is submitted using the post request in the database.

//IN "INQUIRE DETAILS" , THE UI WILL HAVE A LIST OF OPTIONS ACCORDING TO WHICH THE LIST OF FLIGHTS IS DISPLAYED.

7--->SELECT * FROM FLIGHTDETAILS A,DEPARTUREDETAILS B WHERE A.DEST="?" AND B.DEPARDETAILS="?" AND B.ARRIVALDETAILS="?";

8---> CREATE VIEW DETAILS_VIEW AS SELECT * FROM FLIGHTDETAILS A,DEPARTUREDETAILS B WHERE A.DEST="?" AND B.DEPARDETAILS="?" AND B.ARRIVALDETAILS="?";

//ONCE FILES RETRIEVED ,USE THESE QUERIES TO FILTER.

9--->SELECT * FROM DETAILS_VIEW WHERE DESTINATION="?";
10--->SELECT * FROM DETAILS_VIEW WHERE DEPARTUREDATE="?";
11--->SELECT * FROM DETAILS_VIEW WHERE ARRIVALDATE="?";

//ACCORDING TO THE USER INPUT IN "?" , THE QUERIES WILL BE EXECUTED EFFECTIVELY.
